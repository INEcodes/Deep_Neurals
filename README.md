## ‚ú® Key Features & Projects

This repository is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific deep learning task or model. Key projects included are:

### Computer Vision
* **Image Classification:** Implementations for classifying images using various models and techniques.
* **CNN with PyTorch (`CNN_torchvision`):** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) projects leveraging the power of the PyTorch framework and its `torchvision` library for tasks like image recognition.
* **Object Detection (`Object_detection_torchvision`):** Practical examples and code for locating and classifying objects within images using `torchvision` models.
* **Ultralytics (YOLO):** Integration and usage of **Ultralytics** models, likely focusing on state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) architectures for high-performance object detection.
* **Handwriting OCR (`Handwriting_OCR`):** A project dedicated to Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for recognizing handwritten text.
* **Image Colorization (Keras):** Implementation of deep learning models in Keras for automatically adding color to black-and-white images.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Core Models
* **Llama LLM (`Llama_LLM`):** Projects involving the fine-tuning or utilization of the Llama Large Language Model for generative and comprehension tasks.
* **Transformers:** Implementations and usage of the popular **Transformer** architecture, which is foundational to modern NLP.
* **Core Neural Networks (`Neural_Network`):** Fundamental implementations of classic neural network layers and architectures for educational and foundational purposes.

### Specialized Applications
* **PyHealth Models (`Pyhealth_models`):** Deep learning models specifically tailored for healthcare applications, likely using the PyHealth library for clinical data analysis.
* **Identification Models (`Identification_models`):** Projects focused on using neural networks for various identification tasks (e.g., face, biometric, or pattern recognition).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.7+ installed. We recommend using a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# .\venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows (PowerShell)
````

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Since this repo covers multiple projects, dependencies may vary, but the general requirement is PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, and common ML libraries.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone [https://github.com/INEcodes/Deep_Neurals.git](https://github.com/INEcodes/Deep_Neurals.git)
cd Deep_Neurals

# 2. Install common requirements (adjust based on specific project needs)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install tensorflow keras
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
# Additional installs for specialized projects (e.g., Pyhealth, Ultralytics) may be required.
```

## üíª Usage

Navigate into the specific project directory you wish to explore. Most projects are implemented as **Jupyter Notebooks** or **Python scripts**.

### Example: Running the Object Detection Project

1.  Navigate to the object detection directory:
    ```bash
    cd Object_detection_torchvision
    ```
2.  Run the main script or open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook object_detection_analysis.ipynb
    # OR
    python run_detection.py 
    ```
